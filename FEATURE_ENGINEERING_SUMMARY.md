# Feature Engineering Summary

## Overview

We engineered 31 predictive features from raw stock and market data to predict whether a stock will outperform the S&P 500 over the next month. The features include **time-series momentum indicators** (1-week, 1-month, and 3-month rolling returns), **volatility measures** (21-day rolling standard deviation), **technical ratios** (moving average ratios, price ranges, volume z-scores), **relative performance metrics** (stock returns vs. SP500 returns), and **macro-economic context** (VIX, Fed Funds Rate, CPI changes, market sentiment indicators). To ensure data quality, we removed 126 rows (1.4% of the dataset) that lacked sufficient historical data for rolling window features—specifically the first 63 days per stock where 3-month returns cannot be computed. These engineered features improve model accuracy by capturing multiple dimensions of stock behavior: **momentum patterns** identify trends, **volatility features** capture risk-adjusted opportunities, **relative metrics** directly compare stock performance to the benchmark, and **macro indicators** provide broader market context. Together, these features transform raw price data into a rich representation that enables the model to learn complex relationships between historical patterns and future outperformance, moving beyond simple price movements to capture the multi-faceted nature of stock market dynamics.
